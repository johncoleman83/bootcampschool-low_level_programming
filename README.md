# Holberton School Projects Repository

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.  
The focus of these projects are learning the C Programming Language.  
Each directory contains new projects that specifically address learning new
functions and tasks in C Language.

## Directories

* 0x00-hello_world:
  * print text using ``printf()``, ``puts()`` and ``putchar()``
  * get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
  * compile using gcc, phases of compilation, and source code for each stage  
  * Holberton Syntax and Style for C Language Files including comments

* 0x01-variables_if_else_while
  * arithmetic, logical, and relational operators and how to use them
  * booleans, what they are and mean in C
  * how to use: ``if``, `if ... else``, ``while``
  * types: ``char``, ``int``, ``unsigned int``
  * printing differnt types with ``putchar()`` or ``printf()``
  * ``gcc`` flags ``-m32`` and ``-m64``

* 0x02-functions_nested_loops
  * nested loops and how to use them
  * creating functions, and using them in different C files
  * difference between declaring a function and defining a function
  * prototypes and scope of variables
  * ``gcc`` flags: ``-Wall``, ``-Werror``, ``-pedantic``, ``-Wextra``
