# Holberton School Projects Repository

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.
The focus of these projects are learning the C Programming Language. Each
directory contains new projects that specifically address learning new functions
and tasks in C Language.  __Environment:__ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  __Compiler:__ gcc
4.8.4 (C90).

## Directories
