# Hello, World of C Language

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for a software development program.
The focus of these projects is learning the C Programming Language.  In
specific, these projects are designed to show how the GNU C Compiler functions,
Bootcamp C Language syntax and style recommendations.  And how to print a basic
string from the main() function in a C program.  Primarily, these scripts are
used to compile C code and return the differet source code for each stage of the
compilation process.  Including stages: Preprocessor, Compiler, Assembler, and
Linker.  Additionally, the .c files demonstrate printing strings without using
``printf()`` nor ``puts()``.  __Environment:__ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  __Compiler:__
gcc 4.8.4 (C90).

## Primary Concepts Learned

* print text using ``printf()``, ``puts()`` and ``putchar()``
* get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* compile using gcc, phases of compilation, and source code for each stage
* Bootcamp Syntax and Style for C Language Files including comments

## Primary commands / functions used:
``gcc``, ``printf``, ``main()``, ``puts``, ``putchar``
