# Holberton School Projects Repository

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.  
The focus of these projects are learning the C Programming Language.  
In specific, these projects are designed to show how the GNU C Compiler
functions, Holberton C Language syntax and style recommendations.  And how to  
print a basic string from the main() function in a C program.  

## Primary Usage

Primarily, these scripts are used to compile C code and return the differet  
source code for each stage of the compilation process.  Including stages:  
Preprocessor, Compiler, Assembler, and Linker.  Additionally, the .c files  
demonstrate printing strings without using ``printf()`` nor ``puts()``  

## Primary commands / functions used:
``gcc``, ``printf``, ``main()``, ``puts``, ``putchar``
