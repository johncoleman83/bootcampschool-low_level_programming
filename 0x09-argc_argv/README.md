# ``argc`` and ``**argv`` as inputs for ``main()``

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.
The focus of these projects is learning the C Programming Language.

* __Environment:__ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* __Compiler:__ gcc 4.8.4 (C90).

## Primary Concepts Learned

* using arguments in your program
* prototypes of ``argc`` and ``**argv`` for ``main()``
* compile functions with unused variables using ``(void)`` or
``__attribute__((unused))``
