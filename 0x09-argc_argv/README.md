# Holberton School Projects Repository

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.  
The focus of these projects are learning the C Programming Language.

## Primary Concepts Learned

* using arguments in your program
* prototypes of ``argc`` and ``**argv`` for ``main()``
* compile functions with unused variables using ``(void)`` or
``__attribute__((unused))``
