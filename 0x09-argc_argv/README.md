# Holberton School Projects Repository

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.  
The focus of these projects are learning the C Programming Language.

## Primary Concepts Learned
  * using arguments in your program
  * prototypes of ``argc`` and ``**argv`` for ``main()``
  * compile functions with unused variables using ``(void)`` or
  ``__attribute__((unused))``
