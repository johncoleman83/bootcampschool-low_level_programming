# Holberton School Projects Repository

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.  
The focus of these projects are learning the C Programming Language.

## Primary concepts learned
  * nested loops and how to use them
  * creating functions, and using them in different C files
  * difference between declaring a function and defining a function
  * prototypes and scope of variables
  * ``gcc`` flags: ``-Wall``, ``-Werror``, ``-pedantic``, ``-Wextra``
  * header files and including them with ``#include``
