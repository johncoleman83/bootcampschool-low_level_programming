# Functions and Nested Loops

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Holberton School.
The focus of these projects is learning the C Programming Language.
__Environment:__ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  __Compiler:__ gcc 4.8.4 (C90).

## Primary concepts learned

* nested loops and how to use them
* creating functions, and using them in different C files
* difference between declaring a function and defining a function
* prototypes and scope of variables
* ``gcc`` flags: ``-Wall``, ``-Werror``, ``-pedantic``, ``-Wextra``
* header files and including them with ``#include``
